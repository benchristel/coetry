Traversing An Intersection on a Bicycle

thrilling through that expanse,
a blue streaking swallow on a speck of sky,
a white flag bearing through the brief space
in the war against stillness

Minecraft vs. Moonface (draft)
==============================

```
I still remember the places I traveled
spread out between the rocks
And the forests that leapt at my ears
and the sun that spun trails in the valleys
And the moon, that sinister sliver
or the wide-beamed face at the door
in the dark

Or the moon whose white light made sharp shapes on your face
in my dream where the hills were smooth
and empty of death

And that first bright blue world so full of surprises
Or that second bleak world of tight fearful houses
Or the third world of toil and tunnels and towers,
where I drove back the night with my hands.

Or oh, that fourth weary world
Where I said we're like ants.

Where I said
That our fate is to move grains of sand
unless we tell stories.

And I haven't.

except 
for the one in my dream where the hills were all smooth
and the only sharp thing was the face of the moon.
